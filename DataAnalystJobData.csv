The Engreitz Lab launched at Stanford in 2020 and is part of the Department of Genetics and the Basic Science and Engineering (BASE) Initiative of the Moore Children’s Heart Ce...nter. The position is open, and a successful candidate could join immediately.Lab overview: DNA regulatory elements in the human genome, which harbor thousands of genetic risk variants for common and rare diseases and could reveal targets for therapeutics that aim to precisely tune cellular functions — if only we could map the complex regulatory wiring that connects 2 million regulatory elements with 21,000 genes in thousands of cell types in the human body. We have recently developed new approaches that could enable mapping this regulatory wiring at massive scale (see Fulco et al. Science 2016, Fulco et al. Nature Genetics 2019, Nasser et al. Nature 2021, Bergman et al. Nature 2022). We invent new tools combining experimental and computational genomics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and human genetics to assemble regulatory maps of the human genome and uncover biological mechanisms of heart disease.We are looking for creative and passionate people at any stage in their careers, including computational biologists and software engineers. Candidates will train to lead and design computational projects that push the boundaries of genomic technology and reveal the functions of genetic variants associated with human diseases.Specific projects include: to develop and apply predictive models for enhancer-gene regulation, including leveraging the ABC and ENCODE-rE2G framework to capture enhancer synergies and genetic variant effect sizes; to develop and apply methods to systematically benchmark the performance of predictive models; to design and analyze large-scale single-cell CRISPR screens to chart gene regulatory connections and decipher molecular mechanisms of gene regulation.
